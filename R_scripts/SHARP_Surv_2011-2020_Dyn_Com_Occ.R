###Description###
#This code runs a dynamic multispecies (community) occupancy model
#in the form of the dynamic version of the Dail-Madsen model to estimate
#temporal variation in the species richness of sampled sites 
#during a 10-year study (2011-2020) conducted in tidal marshes located 
#from Virginia to Maine. The model calculates site and species-specific
#estimates of yearly population change as a function of vegetative features
#sampled at each site over time. Summary maps are generated to depict sites of 
#increasing/decreasing biodiversity throughout the study period.
