# Tidal_Marsh__Bird_SDMs
All things related to tidal marsh bird species distribution modeling.

Model development is ongoing, with a focus on developing dynamic community models to understand and predict avian tidal marsh community turnover in relation habitat modification caused by human driven impacts such as sea level rise and land use change. All models are described in JAGS and model code is freely available for use in the 'models' folder. Actual tidal marsh bird distribution data are unavailable at this time, but code to simulate sample data is available for all models in this repository in the 'functions' folder.
